## ❌ 错题 1：名字的切换 (Anita vs. Nita)

**题目：** The writer’s shift in name reference from “Anita” to “Nita” is best explained as a...
*   **我的选择 (D):** signal of mood shift between contentment and misery
*   **✅ 正确选项 (C):** **subtle hint that the childhood character has emerged**

### 💡 深度解析
*   **线索：** "Nita" 是她童年时期家人对她的称呼（妈妈和 Jack 都叫她 Nita）。
*   **分析：** 当 Anita 失去理智、挥拳痛打 Jack 时，叙述者改称她为 "Nita"。这不仅仅是情绪变坏（Mood Shift），更是她**退行**回到了童年那个在军营边长大、为了生存必须强悍的 "Nita" 人格。
*   **结论：** 名字的切换象征着**童年生存本能/人格的回归**。她用拳头解决问题，那是 "Nita" 的方式，不是 "Anita"（受过教育的女性）的方式。

## ❌ 错题 2：男性的梦想 (Male Dream)

**题目：** The quotation “that dream of cosy domesticity was a male dream” most strongly suggests that...
*   **我的选择 (D):** women like Anita’s mother lack the time to dream about all the comforts of home
*   **✅ 正确选项 (A):** **only men view working to make a comfortable home as a good thing**

### 💡 深度解析
*   **线索：** Anita 读到书中男老板幻想 "comfy English house, fish and chips"，紧接着联想到母亲劳累的一生 ("flying elbows", "exhausted from scrubbing")。
*   **分析：** 对男人来说，"Cosy Domesticity"（温馨的家庭生活）是享受和梦想；对提供这种温馨的女人来说，是无尽的苦役。
*   **结论：** 这个梦想被称为 "Male Dream"，是因为**只有既得利益者（男性）才会把它看作是纯粹美好的**。女性看透了背后的代价，所以这只是男人的梦想。

## 📖 原文附录：Anita's Dance (Excerpt)

Anita’s Dance
It was a morning fit to convert any pessimist, and a Sunday to boot. Anita spent part of it in the garden virtuously weeding; then she poured enough coffee to float an army into her special mug and brought it out into the garden. Instead of reading, she sat stretching her neck to the sun and thinking how lucky she was; nothing to do but please herself all day. From time to time friends lectured her about being selfish and set in her ways, an old maid. And it was true she was sometimes lonely. She had, however, no reason to feel sorry for herself when she compared her life to theirs. She had a house, a garden, a car, a piano. A good job. A greedy, bad-tempered cat. Two eyes, a nose, and ten fingers, all in good working order. What did she have to feel sorry about? And was happiness selfish? She mused over her library book.
...
“What I couldn’t live with, not ever, is a set-up like this plus a job, plus three children and entertaining for a junior executive now portly and senior. No wonder I’m the way I am.” She frowned at the book, closed it, and put it down. It was cosy, and it was basically English working class, and basically (except for a mob of children) what she had come from. She had never wanted her mother’s life, one of flying elbows and fits of bad temper and aspirations that were a muddle of impulses.
...
Anita shuddered: that dream of cosy domesticity was a male dream: she’d been living in a man’s world too long.
...
Nita took his measure and lashed out, one two, one two, and bang bang bang on his falling head with her fists. Jack went down like a lamb. Nita sat down on the sofa and started to cry.
